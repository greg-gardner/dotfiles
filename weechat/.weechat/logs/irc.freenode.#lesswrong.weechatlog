2015-01-04 01:59:35	@olivia	Ralith: first we need to find out how you weight elements of a hard SF story.
2015-01-04 01:59:46	Ralith	no
2015-01-04 01:59:51	Logos01	blsm: No
2015-01-04 02:00:11	Logos01	blsm: But I do take the actual claims of religions I have first hand experience with to be representative of their actual claims.
2015-01-04 02:00:20	Logos01	blsm: I am a former occultist.
2015-01-04 02:00:34	blsm	Logos01: Not the only one here.
2015-01-04 02:00:47	Logos01	It's hard to go down that route without being familiar with the Thelema.
2015-01-04 02:00:49	Logos01	Anyhow.
2015-01-04 02:03:30	@olivia	the reasoning behind the question i just asked Ralith makes me want to start a blog. so i can write about a Grand Unifying Theory of Literary Criticism. but considering that said thing just occurred to me, it's probably wildly wrong and dependent on lots of things specific to my experience. so i'm not going to. this is a fairly common experience of mine. maybe i should write stuff down anyway.

2015-01-04 02:08:21	Logos01	Basically it's saying that they used a 20-question test to establish a "relationship" between "analytical rumination" and depression

2015-01-04 02:08:48	Logos01	Also I tend to use tmux so sometimes xclip gets wonky
2015-01-04 02:08:49	Ralith	there is exactly one click involved, and no pasting to speak of

2015-01-04 02:09:36	@olivia	it does seem vaguely annoying
2015-01-04 02:09:42	@olivia	maybe i was just primed for that

2015-01-04 10:39:27	kuudes	i made my master's thesis in effort estimation, though likely i think i owuld now have better insights into knowing to what to ask. but i guess that topic has also an interest to me
2015-01-04 10:41:42	Gyrodiot	What is your field ?
2015-01-04 10:42:08	kuudes	i have masters in computer science, Gyrodiot, though i am not very certain what is my field :-)
2015-01-04 10:42:53	Gyrodiot	OK :)
2015-01-04 10:43:57	Gyrodiot	I have a problem with code integration. I'm used to re-code frameworks on the side of a project, sometimes reinventing the wheel
2015-01-04 10:44:06	c0rw1n	one problem in the knot is i simply don't know enough, and the learning curve towards things i actually find interesting looks like ten years locked up with books.
2015-01-04 10:44:06	c0rw1n	problem two is i don't know how to begin to learn basic programming techniques i need, like unit testing. problem 3 is i have no motivation to spend the effort to learn new environments all the time, related to problem 3.5: software sucks, nothing works and everything is broken.
2015-01-04 10:44:06	c0rw1n	Problem four doesn't exist. problem five is i'm always unhappy about my setup and always need one more tool to even begin to work, even though i'm losing so much time pining for tools that i could have done the same work if i just kludged it with what i already had.
2015-01-04 10:46:24	redlizard	c0rw1n: So what are the topics you find interesting?
2015-01-04 10:46:25	cursive	i have had many similar problems c0rw1n
2015-01-04 10:46:26	Gyrodiot	4 will be the hardest to solve.
2015-01-04 10:46:35	kuudes	hmm... if you have x bits of information and you add a new bit there, i guess you have 2x options of (0/1 times possible positions). as loc count measures x but information amount grows with 2^x, perhaps effort should be measured in 2^x...
2015-01-04 10:47:16	c0rw1n	redlizard: extensions to cryptocurrency, and ai-related things
2015-01-04 10:47:27	kuudes	i mean, perhaps the product the people in coding are producing is the amount of information, so loc difference should slow down logarithmically or something
2015-01-04 10:47:29	kuudes	oh well
2015-01-04 10:48:06	redlizard	c0rw1n: Cryptocurrencies will involve studying quite a bit of math but are pretty light in terms of programming.
2015-01-04 10:48:08	kuudes	i have similar feelings than you also c0rw1n

2015-01-04 10:49:12	redlizard	AI is more challenging, but as long as you stay within the boundaries of well-understood techniques it too is more a matter of understanding the concepts than raw programming ability.
2015-01-04 10:49:34	redlizard	If you want to push the envelope with really new stuff, good luck.
2015-01-04 10:49:42	cursive	c0rw1n: you should really try going along with our #lw-ml. i don't think what we're doing is super complicated

2015-01-04 10:49:48	 *	Gyrodiot pushes. It's hard
2015-01-04 10:50:59	c0rw1n	yeah but seriously, my level in math is nowhere near beginning the prerequisites for following the #lw-ml syllabus. even the little i know of calculus and differential equations is obfuscated by the problem that i learned that in french

2015-01-04 11:05:26	pookie	wikipedia: Unleavened bread can refer to a wide variety of breads which are not prepared with leavening agents. Unleavened breads are generally flat breads; however, not all flat breads are unleavened. Unleavened breads, such as the tortilla and roti, are staple foods in Central America and South Asia, respectively.

2015-01-04 13:30:07	@sh	quintopia: As for overeating, some people just aren't prone to it, so this just means they spend less.
2015-01-04 13:30:07	morvkala	I still eat a lot of varied foods - For instance look for the cheapest vegetable with lots of vitamin A, and then the cheapest fruit, cheapest fish, etc.

2015-01-04 13:37:44	@Burninate	There are a lot of different ways to define a state, but the UN fails most all of them.
2015-01-04 13:38:06	kuudes	so already the states of the world have given un that power by getting an un membership.
2015-01-04 13:38:16	kuudes	so it is legal as it currently is.
2015-01-04 13:38:38	@Burninate	I don't believe they have, because I don't believe UN membership requires any de facto compliance.

2015-01-04 13:41:06	kuudes	un charter can be changed to anything as long as there is 2/3 majority of memberstates and no veto.

2015-01-04 14:23:03	Obormot	My point is that the force of the laws to bind the government comes from a hard-to-describe, but very powerful, consensus among the populace
2015-01-04 14:23:11	Obormot	And a complex web of incentive structures
2015-01-04 14:24:25	quanticle	kuudes: For context, in the US, the executive branch has, on rare ocassions, refused to abide by Supreme Court decisions. The most famous example, I think, is Andrew Jackson saying, "Justice Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it," and pushing the Cherokee nation off its homeland even though they won a court challenge to the law expelling them.
2015-01-04 14:24:26	Obormot	The "law" is only the law as long as the government enforces it, and as long as people believe it to be legitimate
2015-01-04 14:24:26	Obormot	Legitimacy does not inhere in documents
2015-01-04 14:24:26	Obormot	Or signatures
2015-01-04 14:24:26	Obormot	Those are certainly things that contribute to the perception, the consensus, of legitimacy
2015-01-04 14:24:35	Obormot	But it's that perception and consensus that actually constitutes the fact of legitimacy

2015-01-04 14:25:27	Obormot	And kuudes's extremely naive-seeming notion of the law as sociopolitical fact just following directly from some document or whatever
2015-01-04 14:25:31	Obormot	Is incorrect
2015-01-04 14:25:33	Obormot	That is my point.
2015-01-04 14:26:14	kuudes	in practice, what happens is what happens.
2015-01-04 14:26:23	kuudes	i agree there.
2015-01-04 14:26:40	Obormot	The consequence of the above is that the U.N. charter is not actually binding on anyone who does not have the actual force to not abide by it
2015-01-04 14:27:12	Obormot	There is no meaningful sense in which, if the U.S. chooses to violate the U.N.'s directives, it is "actually" breaking a "law"
2015-01-04 14:27:29	kuudes	hey, my wallet was stolen some years ago. clearly it was against the law. does that mean that finland had no authority to protect me from theft, as the police did not find the thief?
2015-01-04 14:28:01	kuudes	clearly a wallet was stolen and the thief was not punished as described in the law.
2015-01-04 14:28:17	kuudes	i guess the thief then had the right to steal my wallet per this logic
2015-01-04 14:28:19	Obormot	There's a difference between *trying to enforce a law and failing* and *choosing not to enforce a law*

2015-01-04 14:29:37	Obormot	Alcibiades: De facto, no; de jure, yes. That's why we have those concepts. The former means that you will, in actual fact, get away with doing that thing. That is an empirical prediction. But the latter also has consequences; for example, if the police want to get you for an unrelated matter but have no evidence, they might choose to enforce this toothless law in your case only, for their convenience.

2015-01-04 14:43:48	morvkala	kuudes, a typical government will physically oppose groups that stop paying taxes and break their laws. If an outside force physically intervenes to prevent them from doing this, it's a completely different setup.

2015-01-04 15:14:24	two2thehead	Of course, exports can fall to zero in theory only, not in practice. In reality, high prices will kill the most inefficient, unsubsidized demand first—in the U.S. and Europe. Next, demand will be curbed in net exporting countries, first via the removal of domestic fuel subsidies, and then by world prices. The demand of the four billion people in Asia will be the last to go because they use it most efficiently.
2015-01-04 15:14:24	two2thehead	We should disabuse ourselves of the notion that Americans can adjust to emerging markets demand and declining exports by simply buying more efficient vehicles. First, at the 2011 U.S. sales rate of 12.8 million light vehicles—a rate which will not hold in a scenario of declining fuel supply and increasing economic pain—it would take 19 years to turn over the fleet. Second, our fuel economy simply isn't improving quickly enough.

2015-01-04 16:13:19	morvkala	Burninate, you'd just be getting fractions out of that, neh?
2015-01-04 16:13:24	morvkala	Why not just store the fraction
2015-01-04 16:13:33	morvkala	simpler to implement, less computation

2015-01-04 16:14:49	@Burninate	Just curious if there are any extensions of 'float' that make progress on the inequality issue, which are actually used
2015-01-04 16:16:01	@Burninate	Something marginally less ugly than rounding
2015-01-04 16:16:47	feep	yes. fractions.
2015-01-04 16:16:52	kuudes	((a-b)<c) && (b-a<c)) ? :-)
2015-01-04 16:17:03	kuudes	where c is your tolerance
2015-01-04 16:17:09	feep	abs(a-b) < c
2015-01-04 16:17:17	feep	where c is usually called eps
2015-01-04 16:17:29	feep	or ε if your language is not shit from the 80s
2015-01-04 16:17:29	@Burninate	so "Computer algebra systems such as Mathematica and Maxima can often handle irrational numbers like \pi or \sqrt{3} in a completely "formal" way, without dealing with a specific encoding of the significand. Such a program can evaluate expressions like "\sin 3\pi" exactly, because it is programmed to process the underlying mathematics directly, instead of using approximate values for each intermediate calculation."
2015-01-04 16:17:58	@saturn2	that's not what floats are for
2015-01-04 16:19:33	kuudes	hmm... i think i may be a bit dehydrated. i should drink, i guess...
2015-01-04 16:21:43	Peng	kuudes: are you thirsty?

2015-01-06 01:49:09	spxtr	If you can get a material advantage early that's the best strat.
2015-01-06 01:49:57	spxtr	Get up a piece and then force trades until there's nothing left except for your extra piece.
