2015-01-04 00:00:46	mainframer	Hey folks. 
2015-01-04 00:04:57	mainframer	The closest that I have gotten to ML is through the Bayseian Hidden Markov Models.  Other than that, I'm a blank slate with a bachelors in CS.

2015-01-04 11:27:31	@cursive	blsm: doodle should show the times in your timezone. but the only remaining option at this point is 01:00 UTC. the poll was late-notice, possibly we can redo it for next week with more options
2015-01-04 11:28:38	blsm	I see.
2015-01-04 11:29:22	@cursive	it's pretty hard to choose a good time for everyone since we have range from -8 to +11
2015-01-04 11:31:58	blsm	So it would seem.
2015-01-04 11:32:24	@cursive	might work in the future to have something like two main meeting times, + discussion throughout the day

2015-01-04 11:54:26	realitygrill	anyone good with mod arithmetic?
2015-01-04 11:56:54	realitygrill	I am finding that "- 1 + (-3)" seems to be ambiguous
2015-01-04 11:57:06	realitygrill	in Z5
2015-01-04 12:13:27	Burninate	Doodle:
2015-01-04 12:13:39	Burninate	Next time, 2 hour demarcations, and over more of the day
2015-01-04 12:14:00	Burninate	Also: You don't tell blsm "sorry, doodle is 0100 UTC"
2015-01-04 12:14:22	Burninate	You tell him "Fill out the doodle with your available times, it's looking like this one will be 0100 UTC"
2015-01-04 12:17:38	@cursive	Burninate: you are right, that would have been better. i was thinking for next time to spread it over two days as well.
